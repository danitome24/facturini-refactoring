Feature: See an invoice printed in PDF format
  In order to see an invoice printed as PDF
  As a user
  I need to be able to choose one PDF and download as PDF

  #Scenario: I see new tab with error message when invoice not exists
  #  Given I am on "/imprimir.htm"
  #  And There are no invoices on system
  #  And I fill in "num_reg" with "55"
  #  When I press "Acceptar"
  #  Then I should see "No hi ha cap registre amb aquest número."

  #Scenario: I see a PDF with invoice data
  #  Given I am on "/imprimir.htm"
  #  And There are five invoices on system
  #  And I fill in "num_reg" with "1"
  #  When I press "Acceptar"
  #  Then I should see "Registre num: 1"
  #  And I should see "Nom: First invoice"
  #  And I should see "Adreça: c/ first invoice"
  #  And I should see "NIF: 11111111K"
  #  And I should see "Concepte: Some details about first invoice"
  #  And I should see "Total: 12.5€"
